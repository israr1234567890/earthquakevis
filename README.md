## 📍 Location Features

The application includes comprehensive location services to help you understand earthquake activity relative to your position:

### 🎯 Find My Location

- Click the location button (📍) on the map to find and mark your current position
- Your location is displayed with a blue marker and accuracy circle
- Location data is stored in the app state for the session

### 🌐 Nearby Earthquakes

- View earthquakes within a customizable radius of your location (10-500 km)
- Sort nearby earthquakes by distance, magnitude, or time
- See exact distance calculations for each earthquake
- Expandable panel shows up to 10 closest earthquakes with details

### 📏 Distance Calculations

- All earthquake markers show distance from your location in popups
- Distances displayed in meters (< 1km) or kilometers
- Uses the Haversine formula for accurate geographic calculations

### 🔒 Privacy & Permissions

- Location access requires browser permission
- Location data is only stored locally in your browser session
- No location data is sent to external servers

## 🌟 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

- Redux store setup with RTK Query
- USGS API integration
- State management architecture
- Utility functions and type definitions
- MUI + Tailwind CSS integration

### 🚧 Phase 2: Interactive Map (Next)

- Leaflet map implementation
- Earthquake markers with clustering
- Map controls and interactions
- Real-time data visualization

### 📋 Phase 3: UI & Filters (Planned)

- Filter panel with advanced options
- Earthquake details panel
- Statistics dashboard
- Responsive design implementation

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### Real-time Data Fetching

```javascript
// RTK Query automatically handles caching, loading states, and errors
const { data, isLoading, error } = useGetEarthquakesQuery("day");
```

### Smart State Management

```javascript
// Memoized selectors for optimal performance
const filteredEarthquakes = useAppSelector(selectFilteredEarthquakes);
const statistics = useAppSelector(selectEarthquakeStatistics);
```

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- MUI components for complex interactions
- Optimized touch controls for mobile devices

## 🔌 API Integration

The app uses the USGS Earthquake API:

- **Endpoint**: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/`
- **Data Format**: GeoJSON
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time
- **Coverage**: Global earthquake data

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Scheme (Earthquake Severity)

- 🟢 **Minor** (< 3.0): Green (`#4ade80`)
- 🟡 **Light** (3.0-4.9): Yellow (`#fbbf24`)
- 🟠 **Moderate** (5.0-6.9): Orange (`#f97316`)
- 🔴 **Major** (≥ 7.0): Red (`#ef4444`)

### Typography

- **Headings**: Inter/System fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Body**: Optimized for readability across devices
- **Data**: Monospace for precise numerical display
